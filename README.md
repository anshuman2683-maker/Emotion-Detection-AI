# Emotion Detection using Computer Vision
(Class XII – Artificial Intelligence | Subject Code: 843)

This project is developed as part of the Class 12 CBSE Artificial Intelligence (843) practical project.

## Project Description
The project detects human emotions in real time using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
A webcam is used to capture facial expressions, and a trained CNN model classifies emotions.

## Emotions Detected
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- TensorFlow (Deep Learning)
- NumPy

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy

2. Place all files in one folder:
   - emotion_detection_cv.py
   - haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
   - emotion_model.h5

3. Run the program:
   python emotion_detection_cv.py

4. Press 'Q' to close the webcam.
